# Q5: Storyline for HW4 and final project

<u>**Question 5A**</u>

> I can access OpenSesame.

<u>**Question 5B**</u>

For the final project, I plan to work on the following tasks: 

* Find a dataset on Global Warming.
* Develop a shiny app that allows the users to choose their variables of interest and provide visualizations. 
* Include descriptions for each variable in the dataset, and list out the potential visualizations the user can choose to make with these variables. For example, it is possible to make a bar plot for a categorical and a quantitative variable. 
* If there is time, we will have a linear regression section, where the users can choose variables of interest to model global warming trends overtime. 
* Only concern is how a shiny app would display on a Pkg website. Worst case, we can just include a link to the shiny app that opens on another window.
